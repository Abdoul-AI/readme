# Inclusive Fashion AI Project

The Inclusive Fashion AI project is an initiative of Ai4Innov, an association committed to creating inclusive and diverse AI models for various industries. The aim of the project is to create datasets and AI models that are much more representative of the diversity that exists in the world of fashion, particularly in African fashion.

## Overview

The first stage of the project involved collecting a large volume of data of over 96000 images of African fashion. These images were scraped from Pinterest and some preprocessing was applied to enhance their quality. The dataset is open source and serves as the backbone for AI tools adapted to African fashion.

## Data

The dataset is available as open source, and can be accessed through [insert link to the dataset here]. 

## Models

We have also fine-tuned a model that can generate better images of African fashion. The code used to fine tune and generate these images is also open source, and can be accessed through [insert link to code here].

## Contributions

We are dedicated to contributing to the AI ecosystem and to creating more inclusive and diverse AI models. We encourage contributions to the project and welcome feedback from the community. If you find any issues with the data or models, please feel free to open an issue on this repository.
